# Human Action Recognition Using IMU and Photogrammetry Data
This repository contains the data used in the paper **Accuracy Comparison of CNN, LSTM, and Transformer for Activity Recognition Using IMU and Visual Markers**, including the notebooks used for training and testing.

## Datasets

The datasets can be accessed by the following public Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k2sAkmRyyctE1uOc19mrixyt2N47-7pt?usp=sharing

**Note:** In order to use the notebooks provided, you need to make a copy or a shortcut of the folder in the root of your Google Drive (My Drive).

## Notebooks

The notebooks are divided according to their dataset and the HAR technique (IMU or visual markers). Inside the Notebooks folder, there are 3 subfolders, corresponding to each dataset used, for clarity and ease of access.

## Credits

- María Fernanda Trujillo (Collection of the datasets)
